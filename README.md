# To-Do List
This to-do list app is written in Python, which requires a copy of a Python interpreter to run.

Once Python is installed on your workstation, open a command prompt or terminal, navigate to the folder containing the file and run the application using the 'python' command.

## How to use
The main menu comprises of five options for adding, viewing, marking complete, and deleting tasks. Each option is labeled in the main menu and can be accessed by providing the number associated with the command.

Attempting to remove or mark a task complete that is not listed or providing invalid input will not prevent the program from working and you will be able to continue adding, marking complete, or deleting tasks as you would normally.

## Contributing
Each menu option except for 5 has its own function associated with it as follows:

|1|2|3|4|
|-|-|-|-|
|add_task|view_tasks|mark_complete|delete_task|

If you wish to apply fixes to this application, please modify the function associated with it.
